Before doing anything else, ensure you add the node modules back into the react app. Without these the app will not run. 

npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Guess a letter by clicking on one of the alphabet buttons on the screen.

For each incorrect letter you guess, a part of a stick figure will be drawn.

You can also guess the entire word if you think you know it.

If the stick figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed, you lose the game.

If you successfully guess the word before the stick figure is fully drawn, you win the game.

Enter
Press enter to restart the game and play again.
